Currently I am working as a Junior Consultant and Data Protection Officer at expert SE. Welche Aufgaben in aktueller position?

Throughout my career, I was able to work in the utter most different kinds of work. In my time as a Chief deputy at a local cinema, the variety of tasks made me realize of how much I am structured and interested in multi-tasking. Apart from being responsible for the finances and deciding on which movies to be played, I had to schedule my staff. Further, I was able to spark my creativity in creating marketing campaigns, such as a Guerilla-Marketing campaign for the movie "Deadpool 2", which allowed us to be invited to the German premiere in Berlin in 2018. Due to the sucess of our campaign, I was also invited to talk about my idea in several conferences for local cinemas.
