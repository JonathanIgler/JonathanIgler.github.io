Currently I am working as a Junior Consultant and Data Protection Officer at expert Warenbetrieb GmbH. In this field I calculate and analyse relevant operative numbers as the EBIT/EBITDA, Break-Even-Point, NOPAT and sales breakdowns considering labour force, sales area and the respective location profile as well as ensuring the compliance with GDPR requirements, data protection whilst organising employee training.

Throughout my career, I was able to work in the utter most different areas. In my time as a Chief deputy at a local cinema, the variety of tasks made me realize of how much I am structured and interested in multi-tasking. Apart from being responsible for the finances and deciding on which movies to be played, I had to schedule my staff. 

After a deprivating year for the cinema business, I was able to spark my creativity in creating marketing campaigns, such as a Guerilla-Marketing campaign for the movie "Deadpool 2". Due to the sucess of the latter I had been allowed to join the German premiere in Berlin in 2018. Futhermore, I was also invited to talk about my idea and approach in launching these kinds of campaigns in several conferences for local cinemas.

The ability to work independently arose in my time as a student, during which I worked as a teacher, both for a private school and self-reliantly. My focus lied on teaching both English and German for students of all ages, starting with toddlers up to adults. After having proven myself to be a realiable teacher, I was given full freedom in creating my own lecturing material and methods, which led to an change in the companies way of teaching such that some of my own methods were implemented in the regular study materials of the school I have been employed to. 

For me, sucess comes from hard work which, once combined with enthusiasm leeds to sucess not only for myself, but to everybody involved in the process. Apart from living this in my job, I employ this mindset in my ingterests in fitness, gardening, painting and photograph. Nonetheless I am always keen on new challenges.
