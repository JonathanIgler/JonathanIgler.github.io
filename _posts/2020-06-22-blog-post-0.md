In this blog post I am going to address my personal experiences and how-to`s of marketing from  the perspective of a small cinema in the middle of nowhere of Lower-Saxony.

Starting point
======
I started working at a small cinema in a small town called Alfeld. In its past days, the city which is inhabited by no more than 21.000 people, cinema business was lucrative, such that three cinemas found their respective place. But with time aminly younger people moved to bigger cities in order to find more attractive jobs than simple industry jobs could offer. All in all, only one cinema remained open, with three cinema halls only to provide movies for well aged residents. The cinema had lost its appeal to attract the younger folk due to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime.

First impressions
======
Once I started as a Deputy Manager, I was incorporated by the former Deputy Manager, who has worked in this cinema for over 9 years during which he lost his intereset and passion for cinema business. Instead of trying to make a change, he did what he had to do in order to guarantee a functioning cinema. I, on the other hand, was eager for change. Luckily, I was able to read some cinema business related magazines, which were referring to a certain Mr. Flebbe. This man built new cinemas with affordable prices but luxurious architecture, making cinema special again and making profit out of a "dead" business model. I knew, neither Alfeld nor the owners of the cinema had the conditions to refurbish the cinema, but I thought that there had to be another way in order to generate money far beyond the break-even-point.

Strategy employed
======
"You can not fulfill the wishes of those you don`t know."
Following this philosphy of mine, I started analysing the customers which frequented our cinema, categorizing them by
* genre of the movie
* age
* food and beverages ordered
* time of attendence

By that I was able to assess the needs of the customers and was able to consolidate our supply in such a way, that it fitted more our clients than the beforehand employed methods of "one size fits all". But still, even thought I was able to cut costs by offering what was actually demanded, the struggle of having few customers or even customers from outside of Alfeld remained.
