My opinion about Space X and the reason we should seek the world wide space.

Space X - Some background
======
Founded by the utter most conflicting personality of the last decade, Elon Musk, Space X. The companies foundation goes back to 2002 and was one of the first of its kind: a privately owned space program. Its goal: Developping technologies in such a manner, that traveling space would become more affrodable. Keeping in mind that the space shuttle porgram was to end, the supply would be diminished by 50%. Further, the founderr's goal is to one day be able to colonialize Mars, a planet yet to reached by human beings, bearin gin mind the extreme costs that the current space programmes around the globe would imply.

So, is it really necessary to go to space?
======
Elon Musk sees not only himself, but human kind as "...multi-planet species..."

Aren't headings cool?
