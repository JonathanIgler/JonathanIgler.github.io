My opinion about Space X and the reason we should seek the world wide space.

Space X - Some background
======
Founded by the utter most conflicting personality of the last decade, Elon Musk, Space X. The companies foundation goes back to 2002 and was one of the first of its kind: a privately owned space program. Its goal: Developping technologies in such a manner, that traveling space would become more affordable. 

Keeping in mind that the space shuttle program was to end, the supply would be diminished by 50%. Further, the founder's goal is to one day be able to colonialize Mars, a planet yet to reached by human beings, bearin gin mind the extreme costs that the current space programmes around the globe would imply. Mainly for the latter reason, Space X focus lied on increasing cost-effieciency by iinvesting in the development of reusable rockets. During an interview, Elon Musk referred to it being as commercial flight in the actual days: Sending a rocket to space, delivering its cargo or passengers, returning to earth and after a short turnaround being able to shoot to space once more. 

So, is it really necessary to go to space?

Elon Musk sees not only himself, but human kind as "...multi-planet species..."

Aren't headings cool?
